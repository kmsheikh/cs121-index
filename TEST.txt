REASONS AND IMPROVEMENTS
We noticed that for some of the search queries, which should have relatively good
results, they were returning websites that didn’t have much emphasis on the query itself
or they were outranking others that did. For example, “Donald Bren” and
“undergraduate” were not always returning pages that were relevant or websites that we
were expecting. We found out that a big issue from this was the fact that in our
indexer.py, one of the loops was continuously repeating words as it would repeat
content from previously logged tags. We fixed that, which greatly knocked down
irrelevant results in our search results. Although we did this for some specific query, this
greatly improved the quality of search results of almost all of our queries, which was
expected.


All of the html tags were weighted equally, so the content in some of the results were
irrelevant. We made words in certain tags weigh more so those pages would rank
higher. Words were important if they were in these tags: <title>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <b>,
and <strong>. This was due to the fact that we had many pages that were ranked higher
than those that were more relevant because the “important” tags we deemed were not
weighted any higher. This would allow some random mention of a query to outrank
another website which had that query in its title. We later noticed that the weights we
added were not significant enough as we still had plenty of irrelevant results or results
that should have been ranked much lower than they were. We played around with
different multipliers and came up with a much better fitting ranking. This also helped us
in the areas where some content in the page was still duplicated, which made those be
weighted much lower. We counted words in <pre> and <p> as page content, but noticed
that <pre> held irrelevant HTML, so we knocked it down to just reading <p> tags.
